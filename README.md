# Welcome to Hesham Tayyara's data science portfolio

This repository contains data science projects ordered incrementally by dificulty as follows:

* Used Car Price Predictor: A regression project that predicts the price of used cars based on their specifications with EDA and feature selection based on the boxplot graphs for categorical features and the p-value and the Pearson correlation coefficient for numerical ones
* Mobile Price classification: An EDA-only classification project without a model built because graphical bivariate analysis showed lack of correlation between the independent variables and the target variable
* Diabetes Classifier: A binary classification project that predicts the occurence of diabetes based on lifestyle measures of individuals. The feature selection was done with chi-squared test. It was the most challenging project so far because all the variables were encoded. As a result, I separated the data into binary (True/False, Male/Female) and nominal variables.
I know I could have decoded them using the data card, but I have kept them this way as a way of challenging myself. In addition, it's more time-saving this way


#**I've crossed a long way to get this far in data science. I'm ready to keep crossing longer ones because it's a wonderful field with a huge potential**
